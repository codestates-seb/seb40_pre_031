Event if you remove the repository for your app, you'll get errors if some of your declare jcenter().\nThe best way would be to have PRs merged and version update of those dependencies, but that might take a while.\nIn the meantime you can add the following in your android/build.gradle :\nallprojects {\n    repositories {\n        all { ArtifactRepository repo ->\n            if (repo instanceof MavenArtifactRepository) {\n                if (repo.url.toString().startsWith('https://jcenter.bintray.com/')) {\n                    remove repo\n                    add(mavenCentral())\n                }\n            }\n        }\n...\n\nThis fixed all my builds.",
